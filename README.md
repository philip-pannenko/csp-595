## How to build and deploy the project
* Use Git to clone my repo into any one of your own directories on your computer. Here is the URL you use to perform the clone,(https://github.com/philippannenko/csp-595.git).
* In cmd, navigate to the {project}\bat directory and run the bat file that configures your env. (you may need to update this file to represent your directories. all of the env must be set)
* Navigate to {project}\ant directory (in the same cmd prompt!)
* Type the following command into cmd without the single quotes: 'ant'
* The project should compile and then deploy the necessary file to you tomcat directory for your viewing pleasures, (http://localhost/csp-595)
